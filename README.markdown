WordPress Varnish is a simple plugin that purges new and edited content.

Description
-----------

This plugin purges your varnish cache when content is added or edited. This includes when a new post is
added, a post is updated or when a comment is posted to your blog.

To keep widgets like "Recent posts", "Recent comments" and such up to date, you should consider using ESI
and include them through a text widget for arbitrary text or HTML.

Installation
------------

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Upload `wp-varnish/` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

### Does this just work?

Yes.

### But how should my varnish configuration file look like?

I have provided a simple VCL that can be used as a reference.

### Does it work for Multi-Site (or WPMU)?

Yes. Activating the plugin site-wide will provide the functionality to all
blogs. Configuration can be done on the blogs individually, or can be global.
If you want to configure Varnish servers globally, edit wp-config.php and
include these lines just before "That's all, stop editing!" message:

> global $varnish_servers;
> $varnish_servers = array('192.168.0.1:80','192.168.0.2:80');
> define('VARNISH_SHOWCFG',1);

The varnish servers array will configure multiple servers for sending the
purges. If VARNISH_SHOWCFG is defined, configuration will be shown to all
users who access the plugin configuration page (but they can't edit it).

### My Plugins are seeing the Varnish server's IP rather than the websurfer IP

You could install Apache's mod_rpaf module: http://stderr.net/apache/rpaf/

or, in wp-config.php, near the top, put the following code:

    $temp_ip = explode(',', isset($_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR'])
    ? $_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR'] :
    (isset($_SERVER['HTTP_CLIENT_IP']) ?
    $_SERVER['HTTP_CLIENT_IP'] : $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']));
    $remote_addr = trim($temp_ip[0]);
    $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'] = preg_replace('/[^0-9.:]/', '', $remote_addr );

The code takes some of the common headers and replaces the REMOTE_ADDR
variable, allowing plugins that use the surfer's IP address to see the
surfer's IP rather than the server's IP.
